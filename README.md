Edgar-COMPANY-FILINGS-Web-Scrapping-Data-Analysis
EDGAR, the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system, performs automated collection, validation, indexing, acceptance, and forwarding of submissions by companies and others who are required by law to file forms with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The database is freely available to the public via the Internet (Web or FTP).

# Part 1: Parse files
https://datahub.io/dataset/edgar lists how to access data from Edgar. The goal of this exercise is to extract tables from 10Q filings using R/Python.

Given a company with CIK (company ID) XXX (omitting leading zeroes) and document accession number YYY (acc-no on search results), programmatically generate the url to get data (http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51143/000005114313000007/0000051143-13-000007- index.html for IBM for example). Parse the file to locate the link to the 10q file (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51143/000005114313000007/ibm13q3_10q.htm for the above example). Parse this file to extract “all” tables in this filing and save them as csv files.

# Part 2: Dockerize this pipeline
Build a docker image that can automate this task for any CIK and document accession number which could be parameterized in a config file. We should be able to replace IBM’s CIK and document accession number with Googles to generate the url https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204417000008/0001652044-17-000008-index.htm and then parse this document to look for the 10K filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204417000008/goog10-kq42016.htm and extract all tables from this filing. The program should log all activities, then zip the tables and upload thelog file and the zip file to Amazon S3. Parameterize your cik, accession number and amazon keys so that anyone can put their cik, accession number and amazon keys and locations and reuse your code.

# Missing Data Analysis and Visualization
You are asked to analyze the EDGAR Log File Data Set [https://www.sec.gov/data/edgar-log-filedata-set.html]. The page lists the meta data for the datasets and you are expected to develop a pipeline which does the following. Given a year, your program (In R or Python) should get data for the first day of the month(programmatically generate the url http://www.sec.gov/dera/data/PublicEDGAR-log-file-data/2003/Qtr1/log20030101.zipfor Jan 2003 for example ) for every month in the year and process the file for the following: • Handle	missing	data • Compute	summary	metrics (Decide	which ones) • Check	for	any	observable	anomalies • Log	all	the	operations (with	time	stamps) into	a	log	file. • Compile	all	the	data and	summaries	of	the	12	files	into	one	file • Upload	this	compiled	data	file	and	the log	file	you	generated	to	your	Amazon	S3 bucket (Google on	R/Python	packages	to	use	for	this.The code work for any year on the page.

# Visualization
• Analysis	of	data	using	Tableau.
